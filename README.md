# Cryptocurrency Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project applies K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages across different timeframes (24h, 7d, 30d, 60d, 200d, and 1 year).

## Project Structure
- Cryptocurrency data analysis using Python
- Data preprocessing with StandardScaler
- K-means clustering implementation
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- Visualization of results using scatter plots

## Key Features
- Finding optimal number of clusters using elbow method
- Comparing clustering results between original and PCA-reduced data
- Analysis of feature weights on principal components
- Visual representation of cryptocurrency clusters

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure required dependencies are installed
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb`

## Note
This project was completed with assistance from Claude AI (Anthropic) for documentation and code organization.
